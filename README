INTRODUCTION

Spy on a redis database.


WARNING 

This is primarily a debugging tool for development purposes.
By default, it requests all key/value pairs in the database.

Do not run this against a large production redis-server.


USAGE

redisspy [-h <host>] [-p <port>] [-a <interval>] [-f pattern] [-o] [-u] [-d]

Options:

	-h : specify a host. Default is localhost.
	-p : specify a port. Default is 6379.

	-a : auto-refresh every <interval> seconds. Default is manual refresh.
	-k : specify a key pattern. Default is '*' (all keys)

	redisspy can also query a redis-server and dump the keys and value
	to stdout.
	-o : output formatted text dump of keys and values and exit
	-u : output delimited text dump of keys and values and exit (default is formatted)
	-d : set output text dump delimiter (default is '|')

Commands:

	q : quit

	r : refresh
	a : auto-refresh

	: : command mode (send a command to the redis-server)
	. : repeat previous command (useful for LPOP, etc.)

	f : set key filter pattern. Default is all keys (*)

	s : sort by default (key)
	t : sort by type
	l : sort by length (bytes for string, # items for others)
	v : sort by key value

	j : move down (can also use down arrow)
	k : move up (can also use up arrow)

	ctrl-f : move forward a page (can also use spacebar)
	ctrl-b : move back a page

	? : help


REQUIREMENTS

redisspy works with any Redis version >= 1.2.0.

redisspy requires the hiredis source found at
	http://github.com/antirez/hiredis

redisspy also requires the curses library.  If you have ncurses, change the
Makefile from -lcurses to -lncurses.

redisspy was written and tested on Mac OS X 10.9.2, but should work in 
other Unix-like environments.


INSTALLATION

By default, the Makefile expects to find the hiredis source in the
../3rd/hiredis directory.  This can be changed by updating the HIREDIS_ROOT
variable in the Makefile.

Build redisspy by typing "make".
"sudo make install" will copy the redisspy executable to /usr/local/bin.
